# What And Why of Version Control System

---

## What is Version Control????

Version Control in simple words is the practise of tracking and managing changes to software code. And this is not limited to the software code, it could also include changes to any files documentation, configurations etc.

Now to understand this better let's break down Version Control.

### What does it mean by version?

Version in context of version control System means having specific snapshot or copy of a file(or set of files) at a particular point in time.

Imagine you are working on a project, and each time you save your work is like creating a new version. You might find having different versions (Version1 , Version 2 and so on) over time as you keep making changes.
And each version represents the state of your project at a different moment.

## Version Control System

Version Control Systems are software tools that records the changes made to file (how?) by keeping track of modifications made on the source.
In other words, keeping track of different "versions" of your work.

Now before diving into how Version Control System works, let's try to understand why it came into picture in the first place.

## Why Version Control ???

The need for version control can be illustrated better by comparing how things were done before its introduction.

Imagine you're working on a project, such as developing a simple website. Now, consider the challenges that might arise in a non-version-controlled environment:

**Question No#1** How would you recover a lost file in this scenario?

Now, assuming you're proactive enough to maintain backups, you might have saved different versions of your project to roll back to a previous state if a specific version doesn't work as expected. However, this approach can lead to duplicate code and unnecessary consumption of system memory.

**Question No#2** How do you combine all the changes made by the team members to ensure everyone has access to the final work?<br>

**Question No#3**  How do you address conflicts that arise when multiple team members make changes to the same part of the project simultaneously?
<br>

**Question No#4** How do you identify who made what change and where, especially when you need to trace the history of your project?<br>

**Question No#5** When a bug is discovered, how do you trace it back to the specific change that caused it?


Version control systems like Git provide clear solutions to these questions by enabling efficient collaboration, preserving the history of changes, simplifying issue tracking, and enhancing the overall development process.
